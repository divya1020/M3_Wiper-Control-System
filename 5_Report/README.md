# Wiper control system

## Introduction


The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions.


## Features

- It should on the wiper when button is pressed once
- It should off the wiper when button is pressed twice
- It should remove excess water 




## Software Used

- STM32Cube
- Qemu


# Requirements

There are two types of requirements:

# High Level Requirements


| ID | Description | Status |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| HLR_1    |   If user pressed the button and held for 2 secs, RED LED should be ON |   Implemented        |
| HLR_2    |   The LED glow pattern should be stop on the 4th press |   Implemented        |
| HLR_3    |   Dry after rain stops | Implemented|






# Low Level Requirements

| ID | Description | Status |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| LLR_1 | Frequency should change on user inputs | Implemented |
| LL_2 | Direction of wipers should be change | Implemented |
